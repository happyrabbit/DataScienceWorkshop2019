## [Static Site Generators](https://www.staticgen.com/): Over 400 Choices!

Primary considerations

- Familiarity of languages & tools used
- Availability/quality of docs & resources
- Features vs complexity
- Specialization (blogs, docs, etc.)
- Speed: to develop, build, load

## How to start

- Browse the docs
- Search for tutorials and reviews
- Search for themes or starters
- Explore the files in a sample project
- Try it out!

## Jekyll

- 10 years old! Lots of users, tutorials, themes
- Originally made for blogs, but used for more
- Built with Ruby: versions can be a hassle
- Liquid templating: fairly easy to read
- Markdown content
- Configuration and data files in yaml: easy to read, but whitespace sensitive
- Builds can be slow for large sites

## Hugo

- Few years old; very active development
- Built with Go, but doesn't require Go to run
- Go template language: steeper learning curve
- Content in Markdown, plus shortcodes
- Flexible and extendable, but complex
- Docs are extensive, but can be hard to read
- Reputation for very fast builds

## Gatsby

- Few years old; venture-funded development
- Built with JavaScript (React): very popular
- React component templating: steeper learning curve unless you're familiar with JS/React
- Content in Markdown or mdx (powerful but JS-heavy)
- Lots of plugins and themes (but still code-heavy)
- Static/SPA hybrid structure is fast to load
