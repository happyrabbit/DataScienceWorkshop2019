# The term no one really defined

- What is data science?

> Data science is the discipline of making data useful.  Ok...so what is it?

# What is a data scientist?

Here is a list of definitions for a “data scientist”:

- “A data scientist is a data analyst who lives in California”
- “A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better - at software engineering than any statistician.”
- “A data scientist is a statistician who lives in San Francisco.”
- “Data Science is statistics on a Mac.”

# Different roles in data science

- Researchers: build cutting-edge appliances
- Decision-makers and product managers:  figure out what’s worth cooking / what the objectives are
- Domain experts and social scientists: understand the suppliers and the customers 
- Data engineer and analysts: process ingredients at scale 
- Applied ML engineers: try many different ingredient-appliance combinations quickly to generate potential recipes
- Statisticians: check that the quality of the recipe is good enough to serve 
- Software engineers: turn a potential recipe into millions of dishes served efficiently 
- Project/program managers: keep the interdisciplinary team on track
- Reliability engineers: ensure that your dishes stay top notch even if the delivery truck brings you a ton of potatoes instead of the rice you ordered 


# Types of Questions

- Comparison: 
    - Are males more inclined to buy our products than females?
    - Are there any differences in customer satisfaction in different business districts?
    - Do soybean carrying a particular gene have higher oil content?

- Description:
    - Is the distribution of annual income normal?
    - Are there outliers?
    - What are the means of different customer segments?

- Clustering:
    - Which customers have similar product preference? 
    - Which printer performs similar pattern to the broken ones?
    - How many different themes are there in the corpus?

# Types of Questions

- Classification:
    - Who is more likely to buy our product?
    -  Is the borrower going to pay back?
    -  Is it a spam?

- Regression:
    - What will be the temperature tomorrow?
    - What is the projected net income for the next season?
    - How much inventory should we have?
